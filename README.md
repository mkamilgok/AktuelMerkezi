# AktuelMerkezi

AktuelMerkezi is an end-to-end web application. It lists weekly on sale products of 3 biggest supermarket chains of Turkey all in one website. <br /> <br />
These supermarket chains are [Bim](bim.com.tr), [A101](https://www.a101.com.tr/), and [Åžok](https://www.sokmarket.com.tr/) supermarkets. <br /> 

## Inspiration for the Project
The official Instagram accounts(where on sale products are shared) of these 3 supermarket chains have around **5~8 Million** followers. This means there are millions of people interested 
in these relatively cheaper products. <br /> <br /> 
I believe summing the products of these 3 companies' up in one place will charm the users.

## Development Details - Technologies
Restful web services on the back end implemented with **Spring Boot** Framework. <br /> <br /> 
**Spring Data JPA & Hibernate and MySQL** are used to serve as the database. <br /> <br /> 
**React** is being used for the front end. For now, the front end is developed only for testing purposes, it is being and will be improved. <br /> <br /> 
**JSoup** library is used for parsing the websites of the 3 top supermarket chains and to extract their products' information.
